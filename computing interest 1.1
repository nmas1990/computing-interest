/*
Comput the interest due, total amount due and minimum payment for a revolving credit account. The program accepts the account
balance as input, then adds on the interest to get the total amount due. The rate schedules are the following: the interest
is 1.5% on the first $1000 and 1% on any amount over that. The minimum payment is the total amount due if that is $10; otherwise
it is $10 or 10% of the total amount owed, which ever is larger. Should a be a loop that lets the user repeat this calculation until
the user says they are done.
